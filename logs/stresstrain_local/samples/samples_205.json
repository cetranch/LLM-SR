The strain-stress relationship for the elastic region is given by Hooke's Law: stress is directly proportional to strain. For the plastic region, the stress is equal to the yield strain, which is a constant.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize arrays for elastic and plastic stress\n    yield_strain = params[0]  # Yield strain\n    young_modulus = params[1]  # Young's modulus\n    \n    elastic_stress = np.zeros_like(strain)\n    plastic_stress = np.zeros_like(strain)\n    \n    idx = np.where(strain < yield_strain, 1, 0)\n    \n    # Elastic stress\n    elastic_stress[idx] = young_modulus * strain[idx]\n    \n    # Plastic stress\n    plastic_stress[~idx] = yield_strain\n\n", "score": null}
